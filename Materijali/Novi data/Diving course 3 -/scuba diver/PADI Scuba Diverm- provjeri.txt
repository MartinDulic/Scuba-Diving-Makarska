MAIN INFO
The course is broken down into three main phases, each of which is designed to be engaging and easy to follow. The first phase, Knowledge Development, allows you to learn the basic principles of scuba diving. This can be done through eLearning, taught by our instructors, or independent study, making it convenient for everyone.

The second phase, Confined Water Dives, allows you to learn basic scuba skills in a controlled and safe environment. During this phase, you'll practice essential skills like clearing water from your mask and regulator, controlling your buoyancy, and communicating with your dive buddy.

Finally, the Open Water Dives phase is where you'll put your skills to the test and explore the underwater world. You'll participate in two of the four Open Water Dives required for the Open Water Diver course, allowing you to experience the thrill of diving while still under the supervision of a certified instructor.

Overall, the PADI Scuba Diver course is an excellent option for beginners who want to start diving quickly and safely. The course is designed to be accessible and enjoyable, making it the perfect choice for those who are new to the world of scuba diving.
