DESCRIPTION
Beneath the stunning coastline of the Adriatic lies a world of unparalleled beauty waiting to be explored. For those with less experience in diving, guided beach dives are an excellent option. These dives typically involve smaller, more personalized groups, providing a more comfortable and relaxing experience above and below the water.
Shore dives are typically longer than boat dives due to the shallower waters, allowing you to enjoy the marine life and the stunning colors that come with the extra light. The relaxed pace of beach dives also allows you to fully immerse yourself in the experience and appreciate the range of aquatic life that inhabits these shallower waters.

MAIN INFO
At More Sub, we offer the flexibility to dive when it suits you best, with daily dives in optimal visibility and calm waters.
We will meet at our dive centre at 9:00 am, where you will be equipped with adequate diving gear. After, we have a simple theory for begginers. From there we'll make our way to our beautiful beach and start the diving program.        
 So, why not make your diving dreams come true and step off the nearby beach into a world of underwater wonder? Join us for an unforgettable beach diving experience along the Adriatic coastline. Don't wait any longer, let's hit the beach and discover the hidden beauty of the sea.
