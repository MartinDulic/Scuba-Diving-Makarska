5 6 hours

DESCRIPTION
Snorkeling is a great way to experience the underwater world without the added weight and complexity of scuba diving equipment. With just a mask and snorkel, you can observe a variety of sea creatures and appreciate the beauty of the Adriatic sea. Our half-day snorkeling trip along the Makarska Riviera is perfect for those who want to try snorkeling or prefer a more relaxed approach to underwater exploration.


MAIN INFO
Our snorkeling trip includes one or two stops at different dive spots along the coast, allowing you to see a range of marine life. You'll have plenty of independence and can swim towards anything that catches your eye. While the scuba divers explore the depths, you'll have time to explore the rocks and reefs, observe marine life from the surface, or simply relax on the boat's deck and soak up the sun.

The Makarska Riviera is rich in biodiversity, and our snorkeling trip gives you a chance to observe a variety of sea creatures up close. From colorful fish to sea slugs, crabs, and even seahorses, there's a lot to see. The rocky coves and coral reefs are also fascinating places to visit and explore.

Our snorkeling trip begins at 9:00 am at our dive centre, where you'll meet up with the other scuba divers. After being equipped with your snorkeling gear, we'll make our way to our speedboat. As we head towards the first dive area, you can enjoy the scenic views of the Biokovo Mountain. Our experienced instructors will show you the best spots and teach you some basic snorkeling skills.

Our trip ends around 2:00 pm when we return to the dive centre after all the scuba divers have completed their dives. Join us for an unforgettable snorkeling adventure along the Makarska Riviera and discover the wonders of the underwater world!
