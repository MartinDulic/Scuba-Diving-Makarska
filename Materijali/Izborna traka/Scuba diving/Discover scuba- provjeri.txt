OVO DOLI:

Have you ever wondered what it would be like to breathe underwater, 
to float weightless and move in a 3-dimensional world? 
Or maybe you have been inspired by awesome nature programs 
like the Blue Planet and want to get closer to the action?
The PADI Discover Scuba Diving course allows you to experience
 the thrill of breathing underwater in a fun and exciting underwater adventure. 
The one-day program is designed for complete beginners to give you 
a taste of the mesmerising and serene aquatic environment.
You will dive at two different reefs teeming with marine life. 
The crystal-clear water of the Adriatic Sea provides you with the best view of colourful adriatic fish, 
beautiful corals and sponges, even occasional Marbled electric ray  or Scorpion fish.
